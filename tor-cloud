Tor Cloud AMI


Motivation:

Users on the Internet are being introduced to many cloud-based services today.
Amazon Web Service offers a cloud based hosting service called EC2. Users are able to launch virtual machines and pay only what they use. Tor network can always use more bandwidth and more nodes in different places around the globe. Spot Instances are a new way to purchase and consume Amazon EC2 Instances. They allow customers to bid on unused Amazon EC2 capacity and run those instances for as long as their bid exceeds the current Spot Price. 

We can take advantage of these savings and offer people a way to run relays and bridges on the Amazon cloud with little or no technical experties.The Tor project would maintain it's own AMI on Amaozn S3 which public can launch and quickly add capacity to the Tor network. 

We should offer a number of Pricing and Bandwidth tiers. We can have packages as low as $10/month.
